Artificial Intelligence for Mechanical Integrity Joint Industry Program
Prepared by Acuren, Abyss Solutions, and Equity
White Paper
August 2025
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
There is little doubt that artificial intelligence (Al) is changing the way we process information and solve
problems on a daily basis. The impact on the energy industry is going to be profound as we explore the
integration of inspection data and use Al to help operators make decisions about aging assets. The volume
of data that will be generated to support these aging assets is going to exceed our current capabilities to
process it, necessitating the use of advanced technologies to ensure timely, accurate decision-making
The proposed Joint Industry Program (JIP) will develop a framework to bring together industry
stakeholders to enable this transformation-one that is collaborative, practical, and grounded in
engineering rigor. This white paper introduces the vision, structure, and technical focus of the JIP,
offering stakeholders a clear path to explore the opportunity, see how it aligns with their priorities, and
discover how participation can provide meaningful value to their integrity programs.
This JIP, led by Acuren, Abyss Solutions, and Equity Engineering, is designed to address the most pressing
challenges facing mechanical integrity (MI) today. These include aging infrastructure, mounting regulatory
expectations, inspection performance variability, and the overwhelming volume of data being collected
The JIP goal is to develop a validated, explainable, and scalable approach to Al-enhanced asset integrity
management; one that can be trusted by engineers, regulators, and field teams alike.
Survey results from oil and gas operators collected during the pre-work phase revealed strong industry
interest in applying Al to pipelines, refineries, storage tanks, and offshore platforms. However, key
barriers such as inconsistent data quality, difficulty integrating Al outputs into legacy systems, and limited
trust in Al recommendations were repeatedly identified. These findings have directly shaped the JIP's
structure, ensuring its deliverables are laser-focused on evaluating technologies and building a framework
that is transparent, physics-based, and aligned with operational needs.
The vision for the future is clear: autonomous inspections, continuous risk-based monitoring, and real-
time engineering-based decision support will redefine how MI programs operate. Tools like Abyss's image-
based anomaly detection and Equity's HealthSight explainable-Al platform are already demonstrating the
potential of Al to improve the speed, accuracy, and defensibility of MI decisions. Importantly, this initiative
is not about replacing people with machines, but about empowering experts to make optimized decisions
using enhanced information, faster analysis, and smarter workflows.
For JIP participants, the value proposition is multifaceted. The JIP offers early access to developing a
framework for implanting Al, pilot results, and process templates that can be immediately applied to
improve turnaround planning, inspection prioritization, and maintenance optimization. Participants also
benefit from shaping industry-wide standards, contributing to regulatory conversations, and becoming
part of a forward-thinking community dedicated to long-term collaboration. The formation of a User
Group will ensure that shared learning continues well beyond the JIP's initial timeline.
In summary, the Al for MI JIP represents a unique opportunity to define how Al will be integrated into
the future of MI. By joining, companies position themselves not only to solve today's challenges, but to
lead the industry in establishing a smarter, safer, and more cost-effective framework for managing Mi.
Together, we can set the course for the next generation of MI, leveraging Al.
